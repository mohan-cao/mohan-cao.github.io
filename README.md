Wow it's shiny and flavourful, but also very subdued in a sophisticated way, which does not represent me at all.

## Fun features

- It uses GitHub API to get my recent popular repos
- It uses Thum.io to take a snapshot of the repo homepage
- It's really easy to extend (for some weird reason)
- I totally didn't just rip the majority of the design off https://codepen.io/oliviale/pen/Ebojwm (I did but it was really pretty and I changed quite a lot of stuff apart from the design)

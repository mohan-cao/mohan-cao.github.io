Simple template on top of an annoyingly easy-to-code but hard-to-keep-clean codebase. Should be extendable to nearly all my web projects except for the ones that use Router.

## Fun features

- It uses GitHub API to get my recent popular repos
- It uses Thum.io to take a snapshot of the repo homepage
- It's really easy to extend (for some weird reason)
- I totally didn't just rip the majority of the design off https://codepen.io/oliviale/pen/Ebojwm (I did but it was really pretty and I changed quite a lot of stuff apart from the design)
